## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **self-taught developer** passionate about **web development** and building things from scratch.  
I enjoy learning by doing, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly improving my skills every day.

Right now, my main focus is on:
- Writing clean and understandable JavaScript
- Building interfaces with **React**
- Understanding how the web works under the hood

I value **progress over perfection** and consistency over speed.
